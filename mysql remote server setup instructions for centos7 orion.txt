sudo bash

#install mariadb (generic, free, open-source version of mysql)
yum install -y mariadb-server mariadb
systemctl start mariadb
mysql_secure_installation
#I removed anonymous users, disallowed remote root login, and changed root password to Workshopper!
#then create a new user
mysql -u root -p
#enter password and you're in as root
CREATE USER 'guest' IDENTIFIED BY 'justvisiting'

#then give the user some privileges
##you can check privileges with SHOW GRANTS FOR 'guest';
#So, I gave the guest account the most basic, read-only level of access:
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'guest';

##then, allow for remote connections
vi /etc/my.cnf
#in this file, add a line with "bind-address=youripaddress" -- so mine looks like:
[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
bind-address=10.134.196.46

##restart the server
systemctl restart mariadb

yum install -y iptables-services
systemctl enable iptables
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --destination-port 3306 -j ACCEPT
service iptables save

##you should now be able to log in remotely
##of course, with orion machines, you'll have to be on rice owls to do so (which is a good thing!)
##for me, then, it looks like:
mysql -u guest -h 10.134.196.46 -p
